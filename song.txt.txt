	the 1st song
sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
we're marching into destiny

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

	the 2nd Song
Up onto the overturned keel
Clamber, with a heart of steel
Cold is the ocean’s spray…
And your death is on its way
With maidens, you have had your way
Each of us must die someday!

free translation into Russian
Твой драккар на дне лежит,
Сердце пламенем горит.
И прохладны воды в море,
Но душа не знает горя.
День придёт, наступит час.
Смерть ждёт каждого из нас!
