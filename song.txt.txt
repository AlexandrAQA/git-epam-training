sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
<<<<<<< HEAD
Side by side
we're marching into destiny

Up onto the overturned keel
Clamber, with a heart of steel
Cold is the ocean’s spray…
And your death is on its way
With maidens, you have had your way
Each of us must die someday!
